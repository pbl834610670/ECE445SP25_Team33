I worked on writing the code for the edge detection subsystem and began integrating it with the obstacle avoidance code. Further testing of the sensor readings is still needed to ensure smooth and successful integration. The logic may need to be adjusted to prevent any conflicts between the two subsystems.

We first tested whether the voltage converter could successfully step up the voltage from 3.7V to 12V. After confirming it worked as expected, we connected one end of the converter to the battery and the other end to the vacuum fan. We then tested the functionality of the cooling fan to ensure it was able to effectively suck up dust from the table surface. In addition, we discussed the design of our robot’s base boards with the staff at the machine shop.

We finished writing our project proposal. We considered the details of each subsystem involved in our design and discussed the potential components we might use. We also evaluated different development boards to find out the one that best fits our project. I created the initial visual aid to help visualize our overall design.

## 02/11/2025
We had our first group meeting this week, during which we discussed our goals and the tasks we need to complete for the rest of the semester. It gave us a clearer understanding of the project timeline. 

## 02/02/2025
Our project proposal was approved, and we officially finalized our project topic: Table Cleaning Robot – Autonomous Elevated Surface Cleaner.

## 01/29/2025
I submitted our initial project proposal to the course web board. After receiving feedback from the professor and TA, we made revisions based on their suggestions to improve the proposal.
