I worked on writing the code for the edge detection subsystem and began integrating it with the obstacle avoidance code. Further testing of the sensor readings is still needed to ensure smooth and successful integration. The logic may need to be adjusted to prevent any conflicts between the two subsystems.

We first tested whether the voltage converter could successfully step up the voltage from 3.7V to 12V. After confirming it worked as expected, we connected one end of the converter to the battery and the other end to the vacuum fan. We then tested the functionality of the cooling fan to ensure it was able to effectively suck up dust from the table surface. In addition, we discussed the design of our robot’s base boards with the staff at the machine shop.

I submitted our initial project proposal to the course web board. After receiving feedback from the professor and TA, we made revisions based on their suggestions to improve the proposal.
