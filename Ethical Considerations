The design, development, and deployment of the Table Cleaning Robot must adhere to ethical principles to ensure safety, reliability, and responsible engineering practices. 
This section assesses ethical issues and safety concerns, drawing guidance from the IEEE Code of Ethics.

Public Safety and Welfare
According to IEEE code #1 [5]: “Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public”, public safety and welfare must be ensured. 
The Table Cleaning Robot must operate safely without causing harm to users, pets, or property. 
It must be designed to prevent falls and avoid pushing objects off the table so that no one will get hurt during the cleaning process. 
Therefore, rigorous testing for edge detection, fall prevention, and obstacle detection is required. 

Honesty and Transparency in Design
According to IEEE code #5: “Be honest and realistic in stating claims or estimates based on available data”, honesty and transparency in design are required. 
The capabilities of the robot should be accurately presented. 
If the robots have limitations, the limitations must be clearly disclosed.

Privacy Protection
According to IEEE code #4: “Avoid unlawful conduct in professional activities”, we as designers should notice the importance of privacy protection. 
When we use visual sensors, we must ensure that data is encrypted, avoid storing unnecessary information, and comply with privacy regulations.

Fairness and Non-Discrimination
The project must not create biased or discriminatory outcomes. 
We will conduct bias testing and ensure inclusivity in design and deployment.

Mechanical and Electrical Hazards
The robot has moving parts that could cause injury if mishandled. Electrical components, particularly lithium-ion batteries, pose risks of overheating or short-circuiting. 
Implementation of protective casing around moving parts can mitigate the hazards.

Fall Prevention and Object Handling Risks
The robot must reliably detect table edges to avoid falling and prevent damage to itself and surrounding objects. 
If the robot attempts to move objects, it could accidentally push items off the table.
Therefore, high-precision edge detection systems and object detection systems should be strictly tested. 
Also, implementing redundant safety measures will mitigate risks of failure in mission-critical applications.
